/*This program allows the user to manage his money. The user is able to enter what funds he has and what he has to pay, his expenses
To make things more simple, a user is able to precisely describe each fund and expense by writting how many of each type of money he has, and
by writing whom he owes the money to and what day he has to give it back, along with the amount due and the type of expense.
In this program, the user can also add expenses, add funds, remove expenses, etc.
This program has many householdbudgets each containing funds and expenses, and the user can compare the funds/expenses of each of these households.
